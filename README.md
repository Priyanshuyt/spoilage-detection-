Problem statement : Inefficient Food Storage in Refrigerators Leads to Widespread Food Waste with Cascading Environmental and Economic Impacts.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, around one-third of the world’s food is lost or wasted—that’s about 1.3 billion tons of food per year.

Food spoilage is a global problem, with millions of tons of food wasted annually

This waste not only impacts household budgets but also contributes to environmental degradation.

Inefficient storage methods within refrigerators are a major culprit.

Problem solution : Foodzilla
The "Foodzilla" is a low-cost, IOT based system that uses gas sensors to sniff out spoilage in your fridge. It sends alerts to your phone, saving you money and reducing food waste and saving environment.

Technology used
MQ 5 sensor: The MQ-5 sensor is designed to detect flammable gases like methane, propane, and butane. It's also commonly used for detecting alcohol vapor.
Mq135 sensor: The MQ-135 sensor is specifically designed to detect a wide range of gases, including ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, benzene, alcohol, and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 
ARDUINO NANO: The Arduino board serves as the central processing unit for  project. It collects data from the gas sensors, processes it based on pre-defined thresholds, and triggers alerts or controls other functionalities.
